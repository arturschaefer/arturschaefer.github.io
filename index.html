                        I've been working with Android for over 4 years, focused on Kotlin and Java as the main
                        programming languages. Also, I'm a Flutter enthusiast and enjoy the framework and how easy it is
                        to do applications. Work in a broad range of projects, including mobility, social media, real
                        estate properties, and finance. Some of the projects were built from scratch but others have
                        over 50 million users.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The technical background was provided by a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems, finished in
                        June 2018. While doing the Bachelor's Degree, I was doing an Android Developer Nanodegree from
                        Udacity, which I finished in October 2018. In this course, I was introduced to the best practice
                        of Android and the new Jetpack Architecture Components. In that year Java was the main language
                        for Android applications, but I started to use Kotlin.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        My current responsibility in the technical aspect is to ensure the user's security while using
                        the application. To this goal, my team provides tools to users to validate themselves in a new
                        device using photos, like Selfie or documents, or SMS/email. Another library is to reset the
                        password. In this flow, it's also possible to use Selfie and documents to validate the user's
                        identity, but in this case, it is possible to change the user's data.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        I'm not just a coder so, in the work, I also mentor my fellows with less experience or with
                        doubts. Proposing improvements to the whole project it's part of my daily basis. Code reviews
                        are part of my duty as a developer too, and by doing this it's possible to share more knowledge
                        with our team.

                            This app is built using Flutter. Was my first experience putting a app in production using
                            this framework. I used nice libraries as MobX, SqFlite and YouTube Player.
                            </br>
                            Certainly it was a good experience and I'll develop more apps using Flutter. I like render
                            engine and how all widgets are converted to a Canvas to the screen.
